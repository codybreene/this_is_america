## Implementation Timeline

1. Set up the simple node backend to handle requests to the Twitter API. Explore the Twitter API and make sure you can make queries based on geographic coordinates / cities. 

2. 1st half -- continue Twitter API exploration. 2nd half -- learn about creating a custom google map. 

3. Continue to build out the google map. Customize the view. 

4. Connect the Twitter API logic to the google map logic. Style the trending tweet modal.
